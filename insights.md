AEC Data Challenge: Enhancing Collaboration Without Compromising Security
AEC Data Challenge: Enhancing Collaboration Without Compromising Security
Phil Keeney
June 12, 2025
Collaboration is the lifeblood of success in the Architectural, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. Projects unite global teams, weaving together complex designs, BIM models, schedules, and specifications in real time. Architects, engineers, contractors, and clients rely on seamless data sharing to keep timelines tight and deliverables on point.

Content: They need 3D (
Why does Esri do 3D
).
Sometimes, work crews are dispersed all over the world, technology must therefore connect them and have powerful collaboration capabilities.
To be coherent with customer requests and goals, they are asked to provide digital deliverables (StoryMap on
AEC project delivery subscription for ArcGIS
).
They need to have an interoperable capacity to centralize data and information, such as a central repository.
They must be able to work at different levels.
Above all, these challenges exist in the many projects that need to be managed simultaneously.

Title: AEC Data Challenge: Enhancing Collaboration Without Compromising Security
Content: Here’s what matters:
1. Centralized Project Hub with Design Integration
Choose a platform that unifies communication, file management, and real-time co-authoring while plugging directly into AEC design tools. Solutions paired with Autodesk Construction Cloud, for instance, link project chats, 3D model reviews, RFIs, and document updates to software like Revit or Civil 3D. This keeps data flowing securely between design and collaboration environments, cutting out risky third-party workarounds.
2. Precision Access Management
Your platform should offer fine-tuned controls over who accesses what, down to specific design files or model elements. Role-based permissions, time-limited guest access, and sensitivity labels ensure that a mechanical engineer views only HVAC specs or a subcontractor previews a clash report in Navisworks without exporting it.
3. Robust Encryption and Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

Title: AEC Data Challenge: Enhancing Collaboration Without Compromising Security
Content: Why Legacy AEC Tools Aren’t Enough
Many AEC firms still cobble together a patchwork of tools: email for communication, FTP sites or cloud drives for file sharing, and standalone design software like Revit or AutoCAD for modeling. While these systems may appear to function, we consistently find they lack the integration, governance, and security demanded by modern projects. This creates significant risks and leads to common pain points we frequently observe across the industry, including:
Siloed Workflows
: Disconnected tools create version conflicts, like outdated Revit models or misaligned structural plans.
Untracked Sharing
: A BIM file emailed to a consultant or uploaded to a personal Dropbox slips beyond IT’s reach.
Persistent Access Risks
: External partners retain access to design files or project folders long after their involvement ends.
Compliance Gaps

Title: Digital Transformation in the AEC Industry (+Challenges, Examples)
Content: What Is Digital Transformation in the AEC Industry?
Digital transformation in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry involves reimagining how firms plan, design, build, and manage projects using digital tools and data-driven processes. It’s not about swapping paper for tablets; it’s about
overhauling legacy systems
and
optimizing workflows
to improve how teams collaborate, make decisions, and deliver outcomes.
Across the industry, this shift includes enterprise software like BIM, cloud-based project platforms, mobile field apps, sensors, drones, and automation technologies that reduce manual work and increase transparency. Design teams work in shared models instead of silos. Field crews use real-time data to solve problems faster. Project managers get better visibility into schedules, costs, and risks before they impact margins.

Developers Perspective
As a developer, you may have heard this from your stakeholders:
“Can we make these documents in SharePoint available through the website?”
On the surface, that request sounds simple. But once you look under the hood, the technical complexity quickly ramps up: SharePoint APIs, permission models, auth tokens, sync logic – and a looming question of how to do it without compromising your internal systems.
That’s where
SQList
comes in.
SQList allows you to serve documents stored in SharePoint through your website, customer portal, or mobile app –
without exposing SharePoint at all

Title: 3D geospatial visualization | GIM International
Content: Despite these advances, 3D geospatial visualization has historically been characterized by ad hoc or custom solutions, developed at high cost for specific application needs. While many vendors now provide software for generating 3D models from photogrammetry or Lidar, the next step for value addition in applications is still a challenge.
Data and standards
Spatial data in many 3D visualization applications is often either point clouds (XYZ point coordinates, optionally with properties such as colour or reflectance; Figure 1) or meshes (XYZ vertices, triangle connectivity and optional surface normal, colour or material information). In reality capture, meshes are often augmented with photorealistic texture, obtained from increasingly high-resolution digital imagery. In addition to vertex and triangle data, these have texture coordinates per vertex and associated packed texture images.

Content: The large data question
An ongoing challenge for geospatial visualization is dataset size. Outputs from laser scanning or photogrammetry, either point clouds, meshes or textured 3D models, often comprise many millions – even billions – of points or triangles, and increasingly high-resolution texture images. Traditionally, real-time 3D visualization was limited by the computing hardware available, with high-specification workstations being a prerequisite, and heavy data (and therefore accuracy) reduction being necessary to ensure interactivity.

Content: Several techniques have been developed to aid real-time visualization of large 3D datasets. Level of detail (LOD) approaches allow detailed 3D models to be intelligently simplified, resulting in lower resolution versions that can be rendered faster without losing visual fidelity. Likewise, mipmapping helps reduce the load on the rendering pipeline by optimizing the resolution of texture images depending on the distance between the model and virtual camera position in the 3D scene. A further method, normal mapping, encodes the detailed geometry of a 3D model into an image-like data structure, which is then rendered simultaneously with a coarse version of the model to give a realistic visual appearance. Taken individually, such techniques involve a trade-off between resolution and accuracy to ensure interactive rendering. However, when they are combined with one further, important data structure – tiled 3D models – and out-of-core memory management, a visualization pipeline for almost

Progress in 3D visualization has been dramatic, with the entry threshold for starting new products based on large 3D datasets now greatly reduced. Improved hardware, gaming engines and web graphics APIs facilitate high-performance rendering without the need for advanced workstations. The growing adoption of tiled 3D models and data standards such as 3D Tiles, together with cloud storage, offer a step change in how large 3D datasets can be consumed, shared and published. For the geospatial industry, this lowers the cost for development teams and users, who can now focus resources more on integrating disparate datasets and achieving application results.

**Context:** Disconnected tools like email, FTP, and standalone design software create version conflicts, untracked sharing, and access risks. Integrated platforms such as Autodesk Construction Cloud link Revit, Civil 3D, and project workflows securely

**Source Reference:** https://www.stambaughness.com/blog/aec-data-challenge-enhancing-collaboration-without-compromising-security/

**Key Data:** Disconnected tools create version conflicts, like outdated Revit models or misaligned structural plans. Untracked Sharing: A BIM file emailed to a consultant or uploaded to a personal Dropbox slips beyond IT’s reach

**Priority Level:** high

**Content Type:** how-to guide

**Target Audience:** AEC project managers and BIM coordinators

## Insight #2
**Insight:** Using tiled 3D models and cloud-based visualization tools enables secure client sharing of large point cloud datasets without exposing internal systems

**Context:** Traditional FTP methods are vulnerable to breaches; solutions like NavVis IVION and SQList provide secure sharing via web links or embedded clients while maintaining access controls and data integrity

**Source Reference:** https://www.navvis.com/blog/how-to-work-more-efficiently-with-large-point-cloud-datasets and https://www.axioworks.com/2025/05/how-to-serve-sharepoint-documents-via-your-website-without-exposing-sharepoint/

**Key Data:** FTP servers remain vulnerable to cyber threats and data breaches; NavVis IVION and SQList enable secure point cloud sharing via web links without exposing SharePoint or internal repositories

**Priority Level:** medium

**Content Type:** technical case study

**Target Audience:** BIM engineers and data security officers
