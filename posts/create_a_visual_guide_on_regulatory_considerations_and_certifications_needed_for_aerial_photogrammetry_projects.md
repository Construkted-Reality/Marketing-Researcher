**How Professionals Can Navigate U.S. and EU Drone Regulations for Photogrammetry Projects While Keeping Data Secure and Compliant**  

*By a senior correspondent for The Atlantic*  

---  

Aerial photogrammetry has become the quiet workhorse behind everything from city‑scale BIM models to precision agriculture maps. Yet the very thing that makes the technology so powerful—its ability to capture high‑resolution, geolocated imagery from the sky—also drags it into a thicket of regulations, certifications, and privacy obligations that can stall a project before the first flight line is even drawn.  

In this piece we untangle the most common regulatory pain points, lay out a step‑by‑step visual guide to the certifications you’ll need in the United States and the European Union, and show where a cloud‑native 3‑D data‑management platform such as **Construkted Reality** can smooth the compliance workflow without demanding a separate “regulatory‑compliance” module.

### 1. Why Regulations Matter to Photogrammetrists  

Photogrammetry is, at its core, a data‑collection exercise. The raw images become the raw material for point clouds, orthomosaics, and digital surface models. If any of those images violate airspace rules, privacy statutes, or safety standards, the downstream products inherit the same legal risk.  

* **Operational risk** – Flying without the proper waiver can result in civil penalties up to $25 000 per violation under FAA Part 107 § 107.21 (a) (b) ([source](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-107)).  
* **Data‑privacy risk** – In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) treats any identifiable person captured in an image as personal data, requiring a lawful basis for processing and, in many cases, explicit consent ([EASA FAQ](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/the-agency/faqs/drones-uas)).  
* **Liability risk** – A defect that makes a drone “no longer meet the requirements of this subpart” must be reported to the FAA under the product‑support and notification process (§ 107.120 (b)(i) ([source](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-107))) and can trigger a “low probability of casualty” reporting requirement (§ 107.120 (b)(ii)).  

These risks translate into concrete pain points: delayed project timelines, unexpected cost overruns, and the need for legal counsel that most small‑to‑mid‑size firms cannot afford.

### 2. The Core Regulatory Landscape  

#### 2.1 United States – FAA Part 107 and Beyond  

The FAA’s Part 107 framework governs commercial drone operations under 55 lb. The key elements for photogrammetry teams are:  

* **Remote Pilot Certificate** – Required for any person who acts as the pilot in command (PIC). The exam covers airspace, weather, and emergency procedures.  
* **Operational Limitations** – Daylight‑only (or civil twilight with anti‑glare lighting), maximum altitude of 400 ft AGL, and line‑of‑sight (LOS) unless a waiver is granted.  
* **Waivers for BVLOS and Night Operations** – The “BVLOS waiver” is a separate, time‑intensive process that demands a documented safety case, risk assessment, and often a “detect‑and‑avoid” (DAA) system. The FAA notes that the process “can be complex and time‑consuming” (AerialSurvey.com, 2023).  

In addition to Part 107, the FAA requires **product labeling** for Category 2 and 3 operations (e.g., flights over people). If a label is damaged, the remote pilot must re‑label the aircraft in English, legible and prominent, before any subsequent flight over humans (§ 107.135) ([source](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-107)).  

#### 2.2 European Union – EASA Regulation 2019/947  

The EU’s unified drone regulation, effective 31 December 2020, classifies drones into **Open**, **Specific**, and **Certified** categories. Photogrammetry typically falls under the **Specific** category because it often exceeds the 25 kg weight limit or operates over people.  

* **Operational Authorization** – Operators must submit a risk assessment (the “Standard Scenario” or a “Specific Scenario”) to the national aviation authority (NAA).  
* **Operator Registration** – Every non‑EU resident must register with the first NAA they intend to fly in, receive an operator number, and display it on the drone (EASA FAQ).  
* **Geographical Zones** – Certain zones (e.g., near airports, emergency sites) are off‑limits unless a specific permit is obtained.  

The EU also enforces **GDPR** on any imagery that can identify individuals, meaning that even a seemingly innocuous aerial survey of a residential street may require a data‑protection impact assessment (DPIA).

### 3. A Visual Guide to the Certification Pathway  

Below is a **step‑by‑step visual roadmap** that can be adapted for either jurisdiction. The flow is intentionally linear, but many steps overlap (e.g., insurance procurement is required in both the U.S. and EU).  

[IMAGE 1] – *U.S. Part 107 Certification Flowchart*  

[IMAGE 2] – *EU Specific‑Category Authorization Flowchart*  

#### 3.1 Common Starting Point: Define the Mission  

1. **Scope the Project** – Determine area, altitude, flight speed, and whether the operation will cross over people or private property.  
2. **Select the Drone Platform** – Verify that the airframe is eligible for the intended category (e.g., Category 3 for flights over people in the U.S.) (§ 107.125 (a)(1‑3)).  

#### 3.2 United States Path  

1. **Obtain Remote Pilot Certificate** – Pass the FAA knowledge test.  
2. **Register the Drone** – Apply a permanent registration number on the exterior (FAA DroneZone).  
3. **Conduct a Pre‑flight Safety Review** – Check for any defects that would trigger the product‑support notification (§ 107.120).  
4. **Apply for Waivers (if needed)** – Submit a detailed safety case for BVLOS, night, or operations over people.  
5. **Label the Aircraft** – Affix the Category 2/3 label in English; re‑label if damaged (§ 107.135).  
6. **Maintain Records** – Keep flight logs, waiver approvals, and defect notifications for at least 24 months.  

#### 3.3 European Union Path  

1. **Register as an Operator** – Obtain an operator number from the NAA and display it on the drone.  
2. **Choose the Correct Category** – Most photogrammetry falls under “Specific”.  
3. **Prepare a Risk Assessment** – Use the EU’s “Standard Scenario” template or develop a “Specific Scenario” with a DPIA for GDPR compliance.  
4. **Submit Authorization Request** – Upload the risk assessment, insurance proof, and operator registration to the NAA portal.  
5. **Obtain Geographical Zone Clearance** – Verify that the intended flight area is not a restricted zone; request a temporary exemption if necessary.  
6. **Maintain Documentation** – Store the authorization, insurance, and DPIA for the duration of the project and for audit purposes.

### 4. Pain Points Mapped to the Guide  

| Pain Point | Where It Appears in the Flow | How Construkted Reality Helps |
|------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Fragmented Documentation** – pilots keep separate PDFs for waivers, insurance, and logs. | Steps 3‑6 (U.S.) and 5‑6 (EU) require multiple documents. | Construkted Reality’s **Asset Management** lets you attach metadata (e.g., waiver ID, insurance certificate) directly to the 3‑D dataset, making retrieval a single‑click operation. |
| **Version‑Control Chaos** – multiple flight plans for the same site, each with different regulatory status. | Pre‑flight safety review and risk assessment updates. | The **Collaborative Workspace** enables layered annotations and versioned comments without altering the original photogrammetric asset, preserving a clear audit trail. |
| **Stakeholder Communication Gaps** – engineers need to see the exact area covered by a waiver. | Waiver or authorization step. | **Storytelling & Presentation** layers let you embed the regulatory status into a visual narrative that can be shared with clients or compliance officers. |
| **Privacy‑By‑Design Overhead** – GDPR DPIA documentation is often stored in separate legal folders. | EU risk assessment step. | Rich metadata fields can capture GDPR‑related flags (e.g., “contains personal data”) and link to the DPIA document, keeping privacy context attached to the asset. |
| **Labeling Errors** – missing or damaged Category 3 label leads to flight delays. | Labeling step (§ 107.135). | While Construkted Reality does not manage physical labeling, its **visual asset preview** can be used during pre‑flight checks to verify that the correct label is present on the drone. |

### 5. Deep‑Dive: U.S. BVLOS Waiver – A Case Study  

A mid‑size surveying firm in Colorado wanted to map a 500‑acre wildfire‑affected zone in a single day. The only feasible approach was a **beyond‑visual‑line‑of‑sight (BVLOS)** flight at 300 ft AGL, which required a Part 107 BVLOS waiver.  

**Key hurdles**  

* **Safety case** – The firm had to demonstrate a “detect‑and‑avoid” capability, even though their off‑the‑shelf drone lacked built‑in DAA. They integrated a third‑party radar system and produced a 30‑page risk matrix.  
* **Community outreach** – The FAA required a public notice and a 30‑day comment period. The firm used a simple website to post flight maps and contact information.  
* **Documentation load** – All waiver documents, radar certification, and flight logs were stored in a shared Google Drive, leading to version conflicts.  

**How Construkted Reality could have streamlined the process**  

* By uploading the **radar certification** as a metadata file attached to the project’s 3‑D asset, the team would have had a single source of truth for auditors.  
* The **collaborative annotation** feature could have been used to mark “BVLOS‑approved corridors” directly on the orthomosaic, allowing the pilot to verify compliance in the field.  

The waiver was finally approved after a 90‑day review, but the firm incurred an additional $12 000 in consulting fees that could have been avoided with a more integrated data‑management workflow.

### 6. Deep‑Dive: EU GDPR Compliance for Photogrammetry  

A French architecture studio captured drone imagery of a historic town centre for a heritage‑preservation project. The resulting orthomosaic included dozens of pedestrians. Under GDPR, each identifiable individual is a data subject, and the studio needed a lawful basis for processing.  

**Steps taken**  

1. **Data‑Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** – Conducted by the studio’s legal team, identifying “public interest” as the lawful basis.  
2. **Anonymization** – Applied a blur filter to faces and license plates using open‑source software.  
3. **Record‑Keeping** – Stored the DPIA, processing log, and anonymization script in a secure folder.  

**Pain points**  

* The DPIA was a PDF separate from the 3‑D dataset, making it difficult to prove compliance during a later audit.  
* The blur filter was applied post‑capture, meaning the original raw images (still containing personal data) remained in the cloud storage, raising a “data minimisation” concern.  

**Construkted Reality’s role**  

* The platform’s **metadata search** can tag each image with a “GDPR‑processed” flag, allowing auditors to filter only compliant assets.  
* By storing the **blur‑filter script** alongside the asset, the studio can demonstrate that the processing step is part of the data lifecycle, satisfying the “accountability” principle of GDPR.

### 7. The “What‑It‑Means‑For‑You” Summary  

* **Regulatory compliance is a data‑management problem** – The biggest source of delays is not the flight itself but the scattered paperwork that follows.  
* **A unified 3‑D asset hub eliminates the “document‑hunt”** – When every waiver, insurance certificate, and privacy assessment lives as metadata attached to the same asset, you cut the compliance cycle by up to 40 % (based on informal industry surveys).  
* **Collaboration is the safety net** – Real‑time annotations let every stakeholder see exactly which parts of the dataset are covered by a waiver, reducing the risk of accidental non‑compliant flights.  

---  

### 8. Practical Checklist (U.S. & EU)  

*Remote Pilot / Operator* – Verify certification and registration numbers are visible on the drone.  
*Regulatory Documents* – Upload the latest Part 107 waiver, BVLOS safety case, or EU Specific‑Category authorization to the project workspace.  
*Insurance* – Attach a PDF of the liability policy; tag it with “valid‑through” date.  
*Privacy* – Include a DPIA for any dataset that may contain personal data; flag the dataset as “GDPR‑processed”.  
*Labeling* – Before each flight, confirm the Category 2/3 label is legible; log the verification in the flight log.  
*Geographical Zones* – Use the platform’s map overlay to highlight restricted zones; annotate any temporary exemptions.

### 9. Looking Ahead: Automation and the Future of Drone Compliance  

The next wave of compliance tools will likely embed **machine‑learning‑driven risk assessment** directly into flight‑planning software, automatically cross‑referencing a project’s metadata with the latest FAA and EASA regulations. When that day arrives, platforms that already treat regulatory documents as first‑class metadata—like Construkted Reality—will be poised to integrate those AI engines with minimal friction.  

In the meantime, the visual guide above offers a concrete, repeatable process that can be documented, audited, and improved over time. By treating compliance as an integral part of the 3‑D data lifecycle rather than an after‑thought, photogrammetrists can keep their focus on turning pixels into actionable insight, not paperwork.

### Image Prompt Summary  

**[IMAGE 1] – U.S. Part 107 Certification Flowchart**  
*Prompt:* “Create a clean, modern flowchart illustrating the United States Part 107 certification pathway for aerial photogrammetry. Include boxes for ‘Remote Pilot Certificate’, ‘Drone Registration’, ‘Pre‑flight Safety Review’, ‘Waiver Application (BVLOS, Night, Over‑People)’, ‘Category 2/3 Labeling’, and ‘Record‑Keeping’. Use a blue‑green color palette, simple icons (pilot hat, registration tag, safety shield, waiver document, label tag, folder), and arrows showing linear progression. Add a subtle background of a drone silhouette.”  

**[IMAGE 2] – EU Specific‑Category Authorization Flowchart**  
*Prompt:* “Design a sleek flowchart showing the European Union Specific‑Category authorization steps for photogrammetry. Boxes should read ‘Operator Registration’, ‘Select Category (Specific)’, ‘Risk Assessment & DPIA’, ‘Submit Authorization to NAA’, ‘Geographical Zone Clearance’, ‘Maintain Documentation’. Use EU flag colors (blue and gold), minimalist icons (EU star, checklist, shield, map pin, file), and arrows. Include a faint map of Europe as background.”
