# The available functions on Construkted Reality

This document describes the functionality that is possible on the Construkted Reality platform.  
It also describes what is **not** part of the Construkted ecosystem.

## What Construkted Reality SaaS Product Does

Construkted Reality is an open-access, web-based platform that democratizes 3D data management, visualization, and collaboration. The platform empowers users from global enterprises to individual creators to easily manage, visualize, and collaborate on rich digital worlds directly from a standard web browser.

### Core Features

**Assets Management**
- Manage foundational, un-modified 3D data files with rich metadata (geo-location, capture date, description, etc.)
- Rich metadata search and filter capabilities
- File types and formats which Construkted Reality accepts and can display
  - Polygon mesh
    - OBJ, GLB, IFC  
  - Tiled Models
    - Cesium Format
  - Point Clouds
    - las and laz
  - Ortho
    - GeoTIFF

**Collaborative Workspaces (Projects)**
- Create collaborative workspaces where teams can layer multiple Assets
- Add annotations, measurements, and communication without altering original files
  - Annotation types availble
    - Note, Polyline, Polygon, Place image
  - Measurement types available
    - Point information (coordinates, slope), distance, area, volume
- Real-time collaborative editing environment

**Community Features**
- Connect people through shared 3D exploration and creativity
- Build a global community united by a user-generated digital Earth
- Showcase public user Assets in the Construkted Globe (community centerpiece)

### Target User Segments

**Professionals (AEC, Surveying, Urban Planning)**
- Powerful, scalable engine to streamline complex workflows
- Improve stakeholder communication
- Reduce costly rework
- Make mission-critical decisions with confidence and clarity

**Hobbyists & Creators (Artists, Explorers, Tech Enthusiasts)**
- Accessible canvas to bring creative visions to life
- Share discoveries with the world
- Contribute to a global digital record
- Connect with a community sharing similar passions

### Business Model

**Current Monetization Streams**
- Tiered subscriptions (Hobbyist/Pro/Enterprise)
  - Storage fees
  - Access to more advanced features

**Future Planned Monetization Streams**
- Marketplace for asset sales (with commission and subscription access)

### Future Planned Features
- Full implementation of the Construkted Globe (public showcase of assets)
- Marketplace for asset sales and licensing
- Public API for advanced integrations and automation
- Expanded analytics and reporting tools
- Enhanced collaboration workflows (e.g., versioning, role‑based permissions)

## What Construkted Reality SaaS Product Does NOT Do

### Technical Limitations
- Does not require specialized 3D modeling software or expertise
- Does not mandate expensive hardware or proprietary tools
- Does not limit access to 3D data to specific platforms or applications
- No offline desktop application – fully web‑based access only
- No native 3D modeling or editing tools (focuses on management and collaboration)
- No API access for advanced integrations (planned for future releases)
- Not a photogrammetry pipeline. It cannot process images and generate 3d models.

### Functional Restrictions
- Does not alter or modify original 3D assets during collaboration
- Does not provide native 3D modeling or editing capabilities (focuses on management and collaboration)
- Does not host or store assets beyond the platform's storage limits (requires subscription tiers)
- Does not provide real-time 3D rendering capabilities beyond web-based visualization

### Development Stage
- Does not yet fully implement the Construkted Globe feature (currently in early development)
- Does not yet support marketplace transactions (future planned feature)
- Does not currently provide API access for advanced integrations (future planned)

## User Experience Philosophy

### Mission & Vision
- Democratize 3D data access and collaboration for everyone
- Connect people through shared 3D exploration and creativity
- Build a global community united by a user-generated digital Earth

### Core Problem Solved
- Fixes data fragmentation, inaccessibility, and difficult collaboration for geospatial 3D data users
- Eliminates barriers to entry for 3D data management and visualization
- Provides simple, intuitive tools for complex 3D workflows

## Supported Use Cases
