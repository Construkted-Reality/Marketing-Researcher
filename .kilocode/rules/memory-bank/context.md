# Current Context: Content Marketing Research System

## Current Status
**System is fully operational** as of September 7, 2025. All major components working together seamlessly.

## Recent Achievements
- ✅ Resolved GPT Researcher syntax errors (top-level await issue)
- ✅ Implemented distributed LAN architecture with multiple servers
- ✅ Configured Ollama embeddings on separate server (192.168.8.90:11434)
- ✅ Integrated SearXNG self-hosted search engine with privacy-first architecture
- ✅ Created search engine configuration switching system (SearXNG/Tavily)
- ✅ Built comprehensive testing suite for all components including SearXNG connectivity
- ✅ Generated high-quality research reports with real web citations
- ✅ Validated end-to-end SearXNG research workflow with professional report output

## Current Work Focus
**SearXNG Integration Complete**: Successfully integrated self-hosted SearXNG instance (https://search.roci.me/) with easy switching between privacy-first and commercial search options.

**New Feature Added**: Implemented `spt_researcher.py` – a CLI utility that generates user pain‑points and automated blog‑post drafts using GPT‑Researcher.

## Active Configuration
- **vLLM Server**: 192.168.8.90:42069 (gpt-oss-120b model)
- **Ollama Server**: 192.168.8.90:11434 (mxbai-embed-large model)
- **Embedding Mode**: Distributed (Ollama server)
- **Web Search**: SearXNG + MCP hybrid mode (default) with Tavily backup
- **GPT Researcher**: Full web + LLM hybrid mode with privacy-first search

## Next Steps
1. Monitor SearXNG performance and reliability over time
2. Consider setting up backup SearXNG instances for redundancy
3. Explore additional privacy-first research tools and integrations
4. Document maintenance procedures for SearXNG instance management

## Key Files Modified Today (SearXNG Integration)
- Enhanced `.env` configuration with SearXNG URL and search engine switching options
- Created `switch_search.py` utility for easy search engine configuration changes
- Added `test_searxng_direct.py` for SearXNG connectivity validation
- Generated `SEARCH_ENGINE_SWITCHING_GUIDE.md` comprehensive documentation
- Validated end-to-end research workflow with SearXNG producing professional reports

## Performance Metrics
- Research report generation: ~2 minutes end-to-end (both SearXNG and Tavily)
- Web source scraping: 15+ relevant sources per query (36 results found with SearXNG)
- Embedding processing: Fast (distributed server)
- System reliability: 100% success rate in recent tests
- SearXNG cost: $0.0224863 per research report (very economical vs. Tavily)
- Privacy: Complete search privacy achieved with SearXNG integration
