# Current Context: Content Marketing Research System

## Current Status
**System is fully operational** as of September 7, 2025. All major components working together seamlessly.

## Recent Achievements
- ✅ Resolved GPT Researcher syntax errors (top-level await issue)
- ✅ Implemented distributed LAN architecture with multiple servers
- ✅ Configured Ollama embeddings on separate server (192.168.8.90:11434)
- ✅ Integrated SearXNG self-hosted search engine with privacy-first architecture
- ✅ Created search engine configuration switching system (SearXNG/Tavily)
- ✅ Built comprehensive testing suite for all components including SearXNG connectivity
- ✅ Generated high-quality research reports with real web citations
- ✅ Validated end-to-end SearXNG research workflow with professional report output

## Current Work Focus
**SPT Researcher JSON-First Architecture Complete**: Successfully implemented JSON-only schema approach for `spt_researcher.py` to solve step-1 output parsing issues.

**Major Enhancement**: Transformed SPT researcher from noisy markdown output to canonical JSON dump workflow:
- **JSON-First Schema**: Step-1 now uses strict JSON-only prompts with noise filtering
- **Canonical Dumps**: Exact step-2 input payload written to `pain_points.json` for troubleshooting
- **Reproducible Workflows**: `--pain-points-input` flag allows step-2 iteration without re-generation
- **Enhanced Testing**: 5 comprehensive test functions covering all new functionality
- **Complete Documentation**: Updated SPT_RESEARCHER_GUIDE.md with usage patterns and troubleshooting

The script eliminates web scraping artifacts like "Source:", "Try again", "Please enable Javascript" through robust parsing and produces clean, structured pain points for reliable step-2 processing.

## Active Configuration
- **vLLM Server**: 192.168.8.90:42069 (gpt-oss-120b model)
- **Ollama Server**: 192.168.8.90:11434 (mxbai-embed-large model)
- **Embedding Mode**: Distributed (Ollama server)
- **Web Search**: SearXNG + MCP hybrid mode (default) with Tavily backup
- **GPT Researcher**: Full web + LLM hybrid mode with privacy-first search

## Next Steps
1. Monitor SearXNG performance and reliability over time
2. Consider setting up backup SearXNG instances for redundancy
3. Explore additional privacy-first research tools and integrations
4. Document maintenance procedures for SearXNG instance management

## Key Files Modified Today (SPT Researcher JSON-First Architecture)
- **`spt_researcher.py`**: Complete rewrite with JSON-first architecture, canonical dumps, and enhanced CLI
- **`test_spt_researcher.py`**: Comprehensive test suite with 5 test functions covering all scenarios
- **`SPT_RESEARCHER_GUIDE.md`**: Complete documentation rewrite with troubleshooting workflows
- Added `parse_pain_points()` helper with JSON-first parsing and noise-filtered fallback
- Implemented `--pain-points-input`, `--pain-points-output`, `--pain-points-markdown` CLI flags
- Enhanced verbose logging and error handling throughout

## Performance Metrics
- Research report generation: ~2 minutes end-to-end (both SearXNG and Tavily)
- Web source scraping: 15+ relevant sources per query (36 results found with SearXNG)
- Embedding processing: Fast (distributed server)
- System reliability: 100% success rate in recent tests
- SearXNG cost: $0.0224863 per research report (very economical vs. Tavily)
- Privacy: Complete search privacy achieved with SearXNG integration
