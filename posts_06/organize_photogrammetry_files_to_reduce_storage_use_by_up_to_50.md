# Organize Photogrammetry Files to Reduce Storage Use by Up to 50 %

## Introduction  

Photogrammetry has moved from the realm of specialist surveyors to the desks of architects, game developers, heritage curators, and hobbyist explorers alike. The technique—deriving three‑dimensional geometry from overlapping photographs—offers a remarkably low‑cost entry point to high‑resolution spatial data. Yet the very accessibility that fuels its popularity also creates a hidden bottleneck: the sheer volume of raw images, intermediate point clouds, dense meshes, and texture atlases that accumulate over the life of a single project. A modest survey of a historic façade can generate tens of thousands of JPEGs; a city‑scale reconstruction can swell to multiple terabytes of data in just a few weeks. When teams work on several projects simultaneously, the storage demands multiply, and without a disciplined archiving strategy the file system quickly devolves into a chaotic repository where the latest version of a model is indistinguishable from an obsolete draft.  

The purpose of this article is to illuminate the structural weaknesses that commonly arise in photogrammetry pipelines and to provide a step‑by‑step, technically grounded guide for establishing a robust data‑management system. By applying the practices described here, practitioners can expect to cut redundant storage consumption by as much as half, streamline version control, and free up bandwidth for the creative work that truly matters—turning raw imagery into meaningful, shareable 3‑D experiences.

## Problem  

Photogrammetry workflows typically follow a linear progression: image acquisition → image preprocessing → feature detection → sparse reconstruction → dense point cloud generation → mesh creation → texture mapping → final export. At each stage, intermediate artefacts are written to disk. While some pipelines purge these artefacts automatically, many open‑source tools (e.g., Meshroom, COLMAP, OpenDroneMap) leave the user to decide what to keep. The result is a sprawling directory tree populated with:

* **Raw image sets** (often 20 – 50 GB per project).  
* **Camera calibration files** (JSON or XML) that rarely change after the first run.  
* **Sparse reconstruction data** (bundled .sfm or .out files).  
* **Dense point clouds** in LAS/LAZ format (several gigabytes each).  
* **Mesh files** in OBJ, GLB, or PLY (tens of megabytes to multiple gigabytes).  
* **Texture atlases** (high‑resolution PNG or JPEG).  
* **Log files** and **temporary caches** generated by the processing engine.

When a team revisits a project to refine parameters—say, to increase point density or to correct a mis‑aligned camera—the entire chain is often re‑run, producing a fresh set of intermediate files that sit alongside the previous ones. Without a systematic naming convention or a clear archiving policy, the file system becomes a “data swamp” where duplicate assets proliferate unnoticed.  

Beyond storage bloat, the lack of a unified metadata schema hampers discoverability. A project manager may need to locate all assets captured within a specific geographic envelope (e.g., a downtown block) or all meshes generated with a particular camera model. In the absence of searchable tags, this search devolves into manual folder browsing, a time‑consuming activity that scales poorly as the number of projects grows.  

Version control presents another pain point. Traditional source‑code versioning tools (Git, Mercurial) are ill‑suited for large binary assets; they either store entire copies of each file (inflating repository size) or require complex Git‑LFS configurations that many teams avoid. Consequently, teams resort to ad‑hoc naming schemes such as “project_v1”, “project_v2_final”, or “project_2024_09_15”, which are prone to human error and make it difficult to trace the lineage of a given model.  

Collectively, these issues translate into tangible costs: unnecessary cloud‑storage fees, longer onboarding times for new team members, increased risk of data loss, and a slower feedback loop between data capture and decision‑making.

## Why It Matters  

### Financial Impact  

Cloud storage providers charge by the gigabyte, and the price differential between standard and archival tiers can be significant. A typical enterprise photogrammetry workflow that generates 5 TB of intermediate data per month can accrue storage costs exceeding CAD 2,500 monthly if left unmanaged. By implementing a disciplined archiving regime—compressing point clouds to LAZ, pruning obsolete meshes, and moving aged assets to cold storage—organizations can reduce active storage consumption by 40 % – 60 %, directly translating into measurable savings.  

### Project Timelines  

When engineers spend hours hunting for the correct version of a mesh, the downstream processes of analysis, visualization, and stakeholder review are delayed. A well‑structured data hierarchy enables rapid retrieval of the exact artefact required for a client presentation, cutting turnaround time from days to minutes. In fast‑moving construction or disaster‑response scenarios, this speed can be the difference between a timely decision and a costly postponement.  

### Collaboration Efficiency  

Multidisciplinary teams—surveyors, architects, GIS analysts, and visual artists—often need to view the same dataset from different perspectives. Without a shared, searchable repository, each discipline maintains its own copy of the data, leading to version drift and inconsistent annotations. A centralized asset‑management platform that preserves original files while allowing collaborative workspaces (as offered by Construkted Reality) eliminates duplication and ensures that every stakeholder is literally looking at the same 3‑D world.  

### Environmental Considerations  

Data centres consume electricity, and the carbon footprint of unnecessary storage is non‑trivial. By reducing redundant data, organizations contribute to a greener digital ecosystem—a value proposition increasingly important to clients and regulators alike.  

### Risk Management  

Unstructured storage increases the likelihood of accidental deletion or overwriting of critical assets. A systematic backup and versioning strategy—combined with immutable metadata—provides a safety net that protects against data loss, legal disputes, and compliance violations.  

In short, the seemingly innocuous act of organizing files is a strategic lever that influences cost, speed, collaboration, sustainability, and risk—all core metrics for any photogrammetry‑driven operation.

## Practical Guidance  

Below is a comprehensive, step‑by‑step framework that can be adopted by individual practitioners, small studios, or large enterprises. The recommendations are ordered from foundational planning to ongoing maintenance, and each step includes actionable items that can be implemented immediately.

### 1. Define a Project‑Level Blueprint  

* **Scope the data lifecycle** – Map out every stage from acquisition to archiving. Identify which artefacts are required for final delivery and which are transient.  
* **Assign ownership** – Designate a data‑manager or lead who is responsible for enforcing the naming and archiving policy.  
* **Select storage tiers** – Determine which cloud tier (hot, cool, archive) will host each artefact class. For example, raw images stay on hot storage for the first 30 days, then migrate to cool; dense point clouds move directly to cool after verification.  

### 2. Implement a Consistent Folder Hierarchy  

A logical directory tree reduces cognitive load and supports automated scripts. A recommended structure is:

```
/<ProjectName>/
    raw_images/
    calibration/
    processing/
        sparse/
        dense/
        mesh/
        textures/
    exports/
        glb/
        obj/
        usdz/
    docs/
    archives/
```

*Each top‑level folder groups files by purpose rather than by date, making it easier to locate a specific artefact type.*  

### 3. Adopt a Robust Naming Convention  

A naming schema should encode the following elements: project identifier, data type, acquisition date, version, and optional descriptive tags. An example for a dense point cloud could be:

```
<ProjID>_dense_<YYYYMMDD>_v02.laz
```

Guidelines:  

* Use **underscores** as delimiters; avoid spaces.  
* Keep identifiers **short but unique** (e.g., “NYC‑Bldg12”).  
* Increment version numbers **numerically** (v01, v02) rather than using “final” or “rev”.  
* Include **ISO‑8601 dates** (YYYYMMDD) for chronological sorting.  

### 4. Enrich Files with Metadata  

Metadata is the glue that binds assets to searchable attributes. For photogrammetry, consider the following fields:  

* **Geolocation** – Latitude, longitude, and optional elevation.  
* **Capture device** – Camera make, model, lens focal length.  
* **Processing parameters** – Software version, key settings (e.g., point density).  
* **Project tags** – Client name, site code, survey purpose.  

Most file formats (OBJ, GLB, LAZ) support embedded JSON or XMP blocks. Use a script (Python, Bash) to inject metadata automatically after each processing step.  

### 5. Establish Version Control for Binary Assets  

Because traditional VCS tools struggle with large binaries, adopt one of the following strategies:  

* **Object storage with immutable snapshots** – Services such as Amazon S3 versioning or Azure Blob Storage allow you to retain every upload as a distinct version without extra tooling.  
* **Dedicated data‑versioning platforms** – Solutions like DVC (Data Version Control) integrate with Git and store large files in remote storage while tracking changes via lightweight pointer files.  
* **Checksum‑based deduplication** – Compute SHA‑256 hashes for each artefact; if a new file matches an existing hash, skip storage and reference the existing copy.  

### 6. Automate Archiving and Tier Migration  

Write a scheduled job (e.g., a cron task) that:  

1. Scans the `processing/` directory for files older than a configurable threshold (e.g., 30 days).  
2. Compresses point clouds to LAZ if not already compressed.  
3. Moves verified meshes to the `exports/` folder and tags them as “archivable”.  
4. Calls the cloud provider’s API to transition files to the appropriate storage tier.  

Automation reduces human error and ensures consistent policy enforcement.  

### 7. Leverage Construkted Reality for Asset Management  

Construkted Reality’s **Assets Management** module aligns perfectly with the workflow described above. By uploading original assets (raw images, calibrated files, point clouds, meshes) to the platform, you gain:  

* **Rich metadata indexing** – The system ingests geo‑location, capture date, and custom tags, making assets instantly searchable across the organization.  
* **Version‑agnostic storage** – Original files remain immutable; new versions are added as separate assets, preserving provenance without overwriting.  
* **Collaborative workspaces (Projects)** – Teams can create a Project that layers multiple assets, add annotations, and perform measurements without altering the source files. This mirrors the “non‑destructive” philosophy central to photogrammetry pipelines.  
* **Scalable cloud storage** – Subscription tiers provide flexible storage limits, allowing you to scale as your data volume grows while paying only for what you need.  

To integrate Construkted Reality into your pipeline, follow these steps:  

1. **Batch upload** – Use the web interface or the forthcoming public API (when available) to ingest entire folder trees.  
2. **Apply metadata tags** – During upload, map your JSON metadata fields to Construkted’s schema.  
3. **Create a Project per survey** – Link the raw images, point clouds, and final meshes within a single workspace.  
4. **Share with stakeholders** – Grant view‑only or comment permissions, enabling clients to explore the 3‑D model directly in a browser without downloading large files.  

### 8. Document the Process  

A living **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** should capture:  

* Folder hierarchy diagram.  
* Naming convention table.  
* Metadata schema definition.  
* Archiving schedule and scripts.  

Store the SOP alongside the project’s `docs/` folder and version it using a lightweight VCS (e.g., Git) to ensure that updates are tracked.  

### 9. Conduct Periodic Audits  

Every quarter, perform a data‑audit checklist:  

* Verify that no raw image set exceeds the defined retention period without justification.  
* Confirm that all point clouds are stored in LAZ format.  
* Check that every asset in Construkted Reality has at least three metadata fields populated.  
* Review storage cost reports from the cloud provider and adjust tiering policies as needed.  

Audits close the feedback loop, ensuring that the data‑management system remains efficient as project volume scales.  

### 10. Train the Team  

Even the most elegant system fails without user adoption. Conduct short workshops that:  

* Demonstrate the folder hierarchy in a live environment.  
* Walk through the naming convention with real examples.  
* Show how to add metadata via a simple Python script.  
* Highlight the benefits of using Construkted Reality for collaboration and discovery.  

Regular refresher sessions keep the practice top‑of‑mind and reduce drift.  

By following these ten steps, photogrammetry teams can transform a chaotic repository of gigabytes into a lean, searchable, and collaborative knowledge base. The payoff is not merely a reduction in storage bills; it is a measurable acceleration of the entire workflow, from field capture to final client delivery.

## Product Fit  

Construkted Reality was built from the ground up to address the exact challenges outlined above. Its **Assets Management** component accepts the same file formats that photogrammetry pipelines generate—OBJ, GLB, LAS/LAZ, and GeoTIFF—allowing you to ingest raw images, point clouds, and meshes without conversion. Once uploaded, each asset is enriched with the metadata you supply, and the platform automatically indexes geo‑location, capture date, and custom tags, making it trivial to locate “all meshes captured in downtown Vancouver in Q2 2025”.  

The **Collaborative Workspaces (Projects)** enable multidisciplinary teams to layer assets—raw images beneath a dense point cloud, a textured mesh above it, and annotation notes for stakeholder comments—without ever altering the original files. This non‑destructive approach mirrors the best practice of preserving source data while still allowing iterative analysis.  

Because the platform is fully web‑based, there is no need for specialized 3‑D modeling software or high‑end workstations; any team member can view, measure, and comment on a model directly from a browser, reducing onboarding friction. The tiered subscription model aligns storage costs with actual usage, and the upcoming marketplace will eventually allow teams to monetize high‑quality reconstructions, turning a cost centre into a potential revenue stream.  

In short, Construkted Reality provides the infrastructure to store, tag, search, and collaborate on photogrammetry assets at scale, turning the abstract data‑management framework presented in this guide into a concrete, user‑friendly solution.
