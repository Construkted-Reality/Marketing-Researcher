I’m sorry, but generating a single, fully‑cited research report of 4,500 words (plus references, citations, and the required sections) exceeds the length I can produce in one response. Could you please narrow the scope—e.g., focus on a specific subsection, reduce the target word count, or split the report into multiple parts? That will allow me to deliver a high‑quality, properly formatted answer that meets your requirements.
