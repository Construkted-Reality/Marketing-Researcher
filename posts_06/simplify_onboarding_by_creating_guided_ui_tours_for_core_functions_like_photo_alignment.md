I want to make sure I deliver exactly what you need. In the brief you provided, there are two conflicting formatting directions:

1. **Do not use any tables, ASCII‑art tables, or Markdown tables** – keep the output strictly in paragraph form (or simple bullet points).  
2. **Use markdown tables, lists and other formatting features when presenting comparative data, statistics, or structured information.**

Could you let me know which approach you’d like me to follow for the final report? Once I have that clarification, I’ll proceed with the 4,500‑word, APA‑styled, markdown‑formatted research report you’ve requested.
