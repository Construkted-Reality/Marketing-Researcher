Here's an overview of spatial imaging technologies AEC engineers use to capture and collect data.
In most architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) projects, one of the first key tasks is to gather data on existing conditions. This might start with collecting historical data from available records, followed by some type of project-specific survey to more accurately map site topography and existing facilities. Additional surveys are typically required during construction and after completion to establish as-built conditions.

Derek Baxter answers on how high-precision UAS mapping enables workflows for the future
We’re coming up on nearly a decade of professional and pro-sumer small
UAS
applications for AEC and other industries. You’ll find a UAS in the toolboxes of many surveying, construction, and engineering teams, which do not give a second thought to launching one for nearly any kind of project. But you’ll also find firms that have gotten a taste of UAS potential with the pro-sumer models, that are now at a point where they need to upgrade and refine workflows.
One such practitioner is Derek Baxter, senior surveyor with
Johnson, Poole and Bloomer
, a prominent surveying firm in the UK. JPB has served mining and civil clients for over 150 years but only embraced UAS two years ago. Nevertheless, the company has polished and perfected its workflows to provide rapid and cost-effective volumetric data for clients.

Title: Navigating the Complex Landscape: Challenges in the AEC Sector with a Focus on LiDAR Technology
Content: Pricing Policy and the Downward Spiral
The increasing accessibility of LiDAR technology has led to a surge in service providers, resulting in fierce competition. Unfortunately, this competition often manifests as a 'race to the bottom' in pricing strategies. Firms may undercut their prices to secure contracts, inadvertently compromising on the quality of service.

Title: LiDAR vs Photogrammetry for Aerial Surveying
Content: If the contrast, lighting, subject, and conditions are in your favor, photogrammetry is probably more than adequate for the job. But for challenging mapping projects where elevation accuracy, complex structures, or partly shrouded terrain are involved, LiDAR is probably the way to go.
Of course, the cost and experience of your team will also play an important role in any decision between the two. Although DJI’s latest payloads, the P1 and L1 are testaments to the growing affordability and accessibility of surveying technology.
Ultimately, professionals in the field will need to become adept at using both technologies as the drones that carry them become more sophisticated.

Title: LiDAR vs Photogrammetry for Aerial Surveying
Content: The Cons of LiDAR
The most obvious challenge that comes with working with LiDAR is its cost. Because of the greater operational complexity (and the need for more sophisticated components and sensors), you can easily spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a complete survey solution.
This complexity also widens your room for error and increases the dependence on an experienced professional. With multiple sensors and information that’s not readily accessible without a fair amount of processing, extracting the data you need isn’t straightforward.
It’s also important to bear in mind that traditionally LiDAR sensors have been bulkier than simple cameras. With drones becoming increasingly popular for aerial surveying, the need for a bigger drone to handle a heavier payload can add to an already significant expense.

Title: Navigating the Complex Landscape: Challenges in the AEC Sector with a Focus on LiDAR Technology
Content: Funding Equipment Costs
One of the most immediate challenges in leveraging LiDAR technology in the AEC sector is the high initial investment required for state-of-the-art equipment. LiDAR scanners, along with the software required for data processing and analysis, can be prohibitively expensive for small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This financial barrier often restricts these firms from adopting the technology, thereby limiting their competitive edge.
While larger firms may have the capital to invest, the rapid pace of technological advancements means that today's cutting-edge equipment may become obsolete in a few years. This creates a cycle of continuous investment, which can strain the financial resources of even well-established companies.

Title: Unknown but very useful photogrammetry operations in Metashape
Content: In Metashape, it is possible to draw and snap new shapes to maps and 3D files that are the result of photogrammetry processing. Various snap solutions are also available: to axis, vertex, edge and 2D. For this, the “Draw” window must be opened from the Metashape ribbon, in this case a polygon is required for cutting.
Cutting with shape in Metashape
To cut in Metashape, select the shape that forms the basis for the cut with the left mouse button. After that, the outline of the polygon must be changed to an outer boundary. In the “Ortho”, which displays the photogrammetry results, right-click on the outer line of the polygon, then “Set Boundary Type/Outer boundary”.

Accuracy Concerns
Accuracy is paramount in photogrammetry, but it becomes harder to maintain with larger datasets. The more images you process, the greater the chance of errors creeping into the final model. These errors can stem from poor image quality, incorrect alignments, or cumulative inaccuracies that propagate through the dataset. Data engineers must employ precision tools and techniques to monitor and enhance accuracy at every stage, ensuring that the final product meets the stringent standards required by clients and stakeholders.

Handling large datasets requires substantial storage capacity, which can be a significant roadblock when using photogrammetry software. You need to store not only the high-resolution images but also the intermediate files and final 3D models, which can quickly fill up terabytes of space. This demand for storage can escalate costs and requires efficient data management strategies to ensure that resources are used optimally. And also a data engineers must ensure that the storage solutions employed can handle the high throughput necessary for processing large volumes of data without causing bottlenecks.

Title: Reimagining Geospatial Collaboration: A GitHub for 3D Maps – Construkted Reality
Content: When these functions are coupled with a lightweight, web‑based viewer that supports measurements, layer stacking, and real‑time annotation, the result is a platform that can serve two very different audiences. Professionals get the rigor and audit trail required for regulatory work; hobbyists receive an intuitive canvas to remix a mountaintop scan into a virtual art installation. The synergy between the two fuels a global digital Earth that grows richer with each contribution.
To bring this vision to life, a GitHub for 3D maps would need features tailored to the unique demands of geospatial work. What would these puzzle pieces look like?
Here’s how it could function, focusing on simplicity, scalability, and user benefits:

Title: Collaborating with Confidence - The American Surveyor
Content: Black’s thought process underscores the challenge surveyors face when they want to share information from massive data sets collected from their optical, photogrammetry and scanning systems. That is: the powerful data and software can be too cumbersome and technical for some stakeholders to work with.
In these situations, having a just-right tool to satisfy a minimal requirement can make all the difference in fast, efficient communication.
Clients can better understand project conditions through shared views of the data.
Easier viewing, sharing
In 2016 during the Trimble Dimensions user conference, Black talked with Trimble software developers about the need for a software-agnostic viewer that could run on a browser. In the summer of 2017, Trimble invited him to take a sneak peek at its solution, Trimble Clarity, a cloud-based application included in the Trimble Connect collaboration platform, before it was released at the INTERGEO conference.

Title: Collaborating with Confidence - The American Surveyor
Content: As hardware has become less expensive, more surveyors are making use of the wide range of data capture technologies, and as a result, are collecting massive data sets. But while the process of collecting the data may be straightforward, what to do with the data is not.
At a recent Trimble Business Center user group, many of the pain points shared by 40 attendees centered on one theme: “We have successfully collected a bunch of data, but we don’t really know what to do with it.”
When data becomes too massive to store, process and share, it becomes an intellectual property problem. For example, one customer won’t let their surveyors use the mobile mapping scanners because they are running out of hard-drive space.
Technology, however, continues to improve around connectivity, cloud computing and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which is easing storage challenges and empowering more seamless information and data exchanges between disparate groups.

Content: * AI is technology that behaves like people. This makes it confusing to reason about and work with. Products will need to solve for this cognitive dissonance to be successful, which will entail a combination of UX and guardrails.
* Context still seems to be king. My (possibly outdated) experience has been the "right" context trumps larger context windows. With code, for instance, this probably entails standard techniques like static analysis to find relevant bits of code, which some tools have been attempting. For data, this might require eliminating overfetching.
* Data engineering will be critical. Not only does it need to be very clean for good results, giving models unfettered access to the data needs the right access controls which, despite regulations like GDPR, are largely non-existent.
* Security in general will need to be upleveled everywhere. Not only can models be tricked, they can trick
you
into getting compromised, and so there need to even more guardrails.

Content: I for one am more curious than afraid of AI, because I have always felt that writing code was the worst part of being a programmer. I am much happier building product or solving interesting problems than tracking down elusive bugs or refactoring old codebases.

I disagree with that. I was around when the web grew into the mainstream, and almost everybody was sure that it would have a huge impact on every industry and activity it touched. There wasn't even remotely a level of skepticism comparable to those around VR, blockchain, and now GenAI.
And it seems pretty obvious why. The benefits were clear and palpable. Communication was going to become a heck of a lot easier, faster, cheaper, barriers were being lowered.
There's no such qualitative advantage offered by GenAI, compared to the way we did things before. Web vs. pre-Web, the benefits were clear.

Content: In this sense, the rise of LLM does remind of the rise of frontend frameworks, bootcamps thay started with React or React Native, high level languages, and even things like having great internet; the only people who ask what happens in a less ideal case are the ones who've either dealt with those constraints first-hand, or have tried to simulate it. If you've never been to the countryside, or a forest, or a hotel, you might never consider how your product responds in a poor connectivity environment, and these are the people who wind up getting lost on basic hiking trails having assumed that their online map would produce relevant information and always be there.

Content: should
trust the people who have no stake in selling AI, but are using it to accelerate themselves. The problem is, these people are probably too busy building things to spare any time convincing you. And in fact, it is a competitive advantage for them if others don't figure it out.
Here's my take: Everyone needs to figure out how AI works
for them
. The thing with AI is that it is a technology that behaves like people. It has the speed, efficiency and scale of computers but the fallibility and quirks of humans. This is why it's so confusing to discuss, and why folks have such varying experiences. The right approach to working with AI is like working with people: understand what they're good at and where they are weak, and then
work with them
to achieve your goals.

1 is not a requirement for using agents. You give agents access to a specific workspace and set of tools that you know are safe, similar to how you give the junior dev access to scratch but not prod. Feels like this comment is not in good faith if I’m being honest.

According to the article you are not a serious user of LLMs and are as out of date as the curmudgeon straw men being attacked.
There are zero "safe" tools where you don't control the inputs.

I don't think I would notice a 100% improvement in software productivity in most companies, from the outside. Most of the time, that would just translate to the company being able to hire fewer developers, and having slightly higher profit margins – but not enormously higher, because developers are only one part.

This is exactly what I’ve experienced. For the top-end high-complexity work I’m responsible for, it often takes a lot more effort and research to write a granular, comprehensive product spec for the LLM than it does to just jump in and do it myself.
On the flip side, it has allowed me to accomplish many lower-complexity backlog projects that I just wouldn’t have even attempted before. It expands productivity on the low end.
I’ve also used it many times to take on quality-of-life tasks that just would have been skipped before (like wrapping utility scripts in a helpful, documented command-line tool).

The reason that I personally don't use LLMs was not addressed by the article:
I haven't found a way to use it that makes me develop faster.

A lot of these are regular engineering work that is being done even today. Only it often isn't prioritized because there are always higher priorities... like increasing shareholder value ;-) But if folks want to leverage the capabilities of AI in their businesses, they'll have to solve all these problems for themselves. This is a ton of work. Good thing we have AI to help out!

I don't think it's possible to understand what people mean by force multiplier re AI until you use it to teach yourself a new domain and then build something with that knowledge.
Building a mental model of a new domain by creating a logical model that interfaces with a domain I'm familiar with lets me test my assumptions and understanding in
real time
. I can apply previous experience
by analogy
and verify usefulness/accuracy instantly.

Content: So this is not impossible. You can convince devs like me that your tools are real and they work.
And frankly, there are a billion problems in modern computing that are
high impact
- stuff like Gnome accessibility, competitive browser engines, FOSS UX, collaboration tools. Entire demographics who have serious problems that could be solved by software if there was enough expertise and time and there were resources to solve them. Often, the issue at play is that there is no intersection between people who are very well acquainted with those communities and understand their needs, and people who have experience writing software.

My friends at companies where AI tools are either mandated or heavily encouraged report that they're seeing a significant rise in low-quality PRs that need to be carefully read and rejected.
A big part of my skepticism is this offloading of responsibility: you can use an AI tool to write large quantities of shitty code and make yourself look superficially productive at the cost of the reviewer. I don't
