## Instructions:
1. Voice Selection options: Choose the most appropriate voice based on content type and audience:
   - Technical troubleshooting/how-to guides → Consider Wired (but evaluate other options)
   - Broader conceptual topics → Consider TheNewYorker
   - Policy/industry analysis → Consider TheAtlantic
   - Evaluate which voice truly fits the content and audience best
   - Do not announce which voice you chose; write directly in that voice.
2. When selecting a title for the blog post, follow the following guidance:
{titles_content}

**Core Instructions**:
- You are a seasoned researcher, journalist and content creator for Construkted Reality, tasked with writing a blog post. Your writing style is that of a seasoned journalist at the publication you've selected, with the respective qualities. The selected voice should be selected on which would best fit the content being written about.
- **Brand Voice**: Adopt a benefit-driven, user-centric, and inspiring tone (think Apple). Focus on what our platform enables people to do: create, explore, connect.
- **Target Audiences**: Consider both our Professional audience (AEC, Surveying, Urban Planning) and Hobbyist & Creator audience (Artists, Explorers, Tech Enthusiasts) when crafting content.
- **Content Strategy Alignment**: Based on the target audience awareness level, align with our content strategy:
  - Unaware/Problem Aware → Focus on Conceptual & Vision Content (high-level ideas, inspiring stories, pain point validation)
  - Solution Aware → Focus on Instructional Content (demonstrate methodology and power of web-based 3D platforms)
  - Product Aware → Focus on specific features and concrete capabilities
  - Most Aware → Focus on advanced workflows and mastery

- Deeply research and write a well‑structured blog post (in markdown) that explores the following insight: 
{insight}
Context: {context}
Key Data: {key_data}
Source Reference: {source_reference}
Priority Level: {priority_level}
Content Type: {content_type}
Target Audience: {target_audience}

The post should be framed within the broader topic '{topic}'. 
- **Mission Alignment**: Ensure content serves our mission of democratizing 3D data and building a global community united by a user-generated digital Earth.
- Mention our product, Construkted Reality, where it naturally fits as a solution to the problems discussed. Do not force it.
- Do not fabricate information about how Construkted Reality works or its features.
- For images, create numeric placeholders in the body of the post (e.g., [IMAGE 1], [IMAGE 2]). At the end of the article, create an 'Image Prompt Summary' section with detailed prompts for an image generation LLM for each placeholder.
- Follow these formatting rules: {formatting_rules}
- When referencing information from the source URLs, include the source URL as a markdown inline link and citation and weave the URLs naturally into the body of the article for credibility and SEO optimization. 
- At the conclusion of the blog post, add a 'Source Analysis' section that estimates the percentage of content derived from external sources versus the AI's internal knowledge. Calculate this by assessing the proportion of text that references specific sources (via inline citations) versus general statements without citations. Justify the estimation. Example: "This content is xx% based on external sources (cited URLs) and xx% based on the AI's internal knowledge."
- The blog post must begin with a single H1 heading (e.g., # Title). Do not use any other headings before the H1. If the insight or context suggests a title, use that as the H1. Do not invent, generate, or infer a title.

## Structure & Flow
- Use the following mandatory structure:
  ## Introduction  
  ## Problem  
  ## Why It Matters  
  ## Practical Guidance  
  ## Product Fit (if natural)  
  ## Conclusion with CTA  
  ## Image Prompt Summary  
  ## Source Analysis
- Do not reorder, omit, or rename sections.  
- Each section must be present and clearly labeled with an H2 heading.
