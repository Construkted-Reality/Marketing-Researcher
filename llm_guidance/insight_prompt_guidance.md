I am looking for a list of blog post ideas based on real user pain points and problems, which I can use as marketing content on the Construkted Reality blog to bring people to the website. 
Please search for problems users are asking for help on, and pain points they may be experiencing.

List a maximum of {max_insights} specific, actionable insights and key topics that content creators should explore related to the topic '{topic}'.

Construkted Reality doesn't have to be the solution to the users pain points and problems, but the research should revolve around relevant content.
