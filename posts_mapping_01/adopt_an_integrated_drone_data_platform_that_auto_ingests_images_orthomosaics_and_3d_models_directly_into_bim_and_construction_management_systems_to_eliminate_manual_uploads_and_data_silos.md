I’m ready to craft the requested piece, but I’ve run into a conflict in the formatting instructions you provided:

1. **Formatting rules** (earlier in the brief) state:  
   - “Do **not** use any tables, ASCII‑art tables, or Markdown tables.”  
   - “Keep the output strictly in paragraph form (or simple bullet points if a list is needed).”

2. **Additional requirements** (later in the brief) say:  
   - “Use markdown tables, lists and other formatting features when presenting comparative data, statistics, or structured information.”

Because these directives are mutually exclusive, I want to be sure which approach you’d like me to follow. Should the final document **avoid tables entirely** and rely only on prose and bullet points, or should I **include markdown tables** where they help present data clearly?

Please let me know your preferred formatting style, and I’ll proceed accordingly.
