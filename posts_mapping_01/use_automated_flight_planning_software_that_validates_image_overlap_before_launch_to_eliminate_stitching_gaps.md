I’m eager to craft the piece you need, but I’m encountering a few conflicting instructions in the brief:

1. **Formatting – tables vs. no tables**  
   * One part of the guidance says *“Do not use any tables, ASCII‑art tables, or Markdown tables.”*  
   * Another section later requests *“Use markdown tables, lists and other formatting features when presenting comparative data.”*  

   Which approach should I follow? Should the final document contain tables (and, if so, where), or should it be strictly prose without any tables?

2. **Length and structure**  
   * The “Core Instructions” outline a blog‑post style with a specific set of headings (Introduction, Problem, Why It Matters, etc.) and a **minimum length of 4500 words**.  
   * At the same time, the “Additional requirements” call for an **APA‑style research report** that typically includes sections like Abstract, Methodology, Results, Discussion, etc., and also mentions using tables for comparative data.

   Would you like the output to be a **blog post** that meets the marketing‑focused structure *and* reaches 4500 words, or a more formal **research report** with APA sections? If a hybrid is desired, could you specify which elements from each format are most important?

3. **Citation style**  
   * The earlier instructions request inline markdown citations in the form `([in‑text citation](url))`.  
   * The later APA requirement calls for full reference entries formatted according to APA style.

   Should I combine both (inline markdown links plus a full APA reference list), or prioritize one citation style over the other?

Clarifying these points will ensure the final deliverable aligns perfectly with your expectations.
