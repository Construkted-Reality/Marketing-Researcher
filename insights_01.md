Title: Why 3Dsurvey is the Best Photogrammetry Software in 2025? | 3Dsurvey
Content: Introduction
The photogrammetry world in 2025 is full of bloated platforms, hidden costs, and tools built for demos – not real work. 3Dsurvey takes a different path. Built by land surveyors in Europe, it offers a clean, modular, and professional solution that delivers exactly what you need – from drone data, cameras and even smartphones, to CAD-ready deliverables, without locking you into overpriced ecosystems. Here’s why thousands of our users believe it is the
best photogrammetry software in 2025
and it’s become the go-to platform for professionals worldwide.
Only surveyors can build the best photogrammetry software in 2025
3Dsurvey wasn’t imagined in a boardroom, it was built in the field. The people behind it are surveyors who got tired of wasting time with software that looked impressive but didn’t help get the job done. That’s why everything in 3Dsurvey, from the interface to the tools, is shaped around how real projects work, not how someone
thinks
they work.

What is the best photogrammetry software in 2025?
With each new iteration, photogrammetry software is only getting faster, easier to use and delivering more detailed results.
There’s only one problem:
the market is now becoming so competitive, users are spoilt for choice. How do you know which program to choose? Numerous factors come into play including learning curve, support, detail capture, file format, cost, and so much more.
If that sounds like a lot to process, it can be! But don’t let the initial barriers to entry put you off. Once you get your head around the basics, photogrammetry is fantastic for creating ultra-realistic 3D models of everything from objects to people and entire landscapes.

Content: Regulatory Issues: The regulatory frameworks that relate to the management of airspace data privacy, airspace management, as well as intellectual property rights put limitations regarding the usage of airborne photography and photogrammetry technology, demanding to comply with the law and could limit the expansion of markets.
Information Processing Complexity: Despite advances in computer automation, the treatment and evaluation of massive amounts of aerial images can be time-consuming and complicated needing special skills and knowledge which could slow growth in certain areas.
Data Security Beware: The acquisition storage, sharing, and storage of geospatial data has raised questions about security of data privacy breaches, data security, and access that is not authorized that have led to cautious adoption of photogrammetry tools, especially in industries and applications that are sensitive.

Hi all,
I recently decided I'd dabble in some photogrammetry with our office drone and have been really quite surprised at the quality of the results I managed to achieve. The only downside is that the meshes that are generated are (as you might expect) incredibly uneconomical when it comes to triangles, and the texture atlases are wild - unusable if I wanted to edit them in say photoshop, for example.

Various photogrammetry workflow questions
I've got a project where I'm doing photogrammetry of a room. I'll describe the room itself, my planned hardware and software stack and then get on to my questions.

Content: The final image included here is the single frame used by the photogrammetry software for texture mapping. Although it gives the appearance at first glance of being an aerial photograph of a strangely featureless landscape, this file is actually an indexed palette of all the color and texture combinations present on all surfaces of the 3D model. If photogrammetry constitutes the key technology operating in the interstices between data and images, these files are arguably the most liminal of all its components. Neither mimetic nor computational, they provide visual information (“pixel-data”) that is necessary to the perceptual phenomenon of photorealism, while denying the pleasures of recognition. In a literal sense, this single image contains every color and texture that may be seen in the 3D model, rendered here as an abstraction fully legible only to the eyes of the machine.

Content: Note: if you have somehow stumbled on this post and are hoping to learn the correct way to use Metashape, please look elsewhere. The internet is full of people – many of whom don’t really know what they’re doing – offering authoritative advice on how to use this particular piece of software and I don’t want to add myself to the list. While it’s true that my eventual goal is to gain proficiency with various photogrammetry workflows, I’m currently deriving at least equal pleasure from my near total inability to execute any part of this process as intended. Even the measuring sticks in the above image are of my own conception and may not serve any useful purpose whatsoever.

Content: Secondly, assuming the other software churns out fairly similar stuff, how would you suggest editing these meshes so they're a bit less unwieldy. I've tried the ProOptimizer modifier in 3ds max, but that seems to just hang forever without doing anything. I've also tried the new retopology tools in max, but again the same result; it just hangs.
Any suggestions as to how to clean up the meshes, and bake the textures into a useable form would be much appreciated.
Many thanks,
Chris
Hi Chris,
For improving your photogrammetry workflow:
Consider switching to software like Agisoft Metashape or RealityCapture for better mesh and texture control.
Try decimation or manual retopology for mesh optimization.
Use UV unwrapping and texture baking tools like Blender or Substance Painter for better texture editing.
Incorporate
ground control point targets (GCPs)
for increased model accuracy.
Best,
John Ethan

Content: 5. What is the most important metric for a content creator to track?
There is no single "most important" metric. It depends on your goal. For brand collaborations, "Reach" is often most important. For building a strong community, "Engagement Rate" and "Comments" are key. For positioning yourself as an expert, "Saves" are incredibly valuable. The best approach is to track a combination of metrics that align with your specific creator goals.
6. My follower count is growing, but my engagement is low. What should I do?
This is a common problem and often indicates a mismatch between your new followers and your content. It could mean you gained followers from a viral Reel that isn't representative of your usual content. The solution is to focus on re-engaging your community. Use interactive Stories (polls, Q&As, quizzes) and ask direct questions in your captions to spark conversation and remind your audience why they followed you.
