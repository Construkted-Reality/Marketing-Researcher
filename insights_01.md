Photogrammetry Newbie is looking for a workflow
Hello Com,
I'm pretty new to this whole subject of photogrammetry. I understand the basics and now I want to play around with it and create my own 3D-Models. But how do I start? Currently I'm searching for decent software solutions. Can you guys recommend me something which is free? Obviously I want to create a point cloud out of my pictures, edit pointclouds and mesh them. Maybe additional functions like intersecting pointclounds, editing the mesh or bring the whole model into scale would be cool.
I stumbled over VisualSFM, but I couldn't get great results.
Thank you very much!

Title: Complete Photogrammetry Workflow | The Gnomon Workshop
Content: Charleston kicks off the workshop with the capture before demonstrating the image processing part of the workflow using Photoshop, Adobe Camera RAW, and Adobe DNG. From there, it’s all about the solve, for which Charleston brings both RealityCapture and Metashape into the fold. Mesh retopology is handled and demonstrated in ZBrush, while the effective texture generation and cleanup process employs the power of Substance Painter. As the final step, the assembly of the scene takes place in Unreal Engine — although, the process and techniques covered can be used with any renderer of choice.
This detailed workshop covers a vast array of information and techniques, discussing everything from the dos and don'ts of capturing to the subtle details for image adjustments and solves that you won’t want to miss. Charleston’s thorough instruction not only teaches how to set everything up correctly to achieve the best results but also advises on the importance of every step of the process.

Impossible-Mood-6823
Can the whole workflow of photogrammetry be created from scratch??
I am working on a project to create an industrial/commercial product that creates a 3d reconstruction of objects captured from drone cameras. The photogrammetry software I looked through were: MetaShape, 3df Zephyr, and pix4D and I am appalled by the amount they asked to own the software, and I do not think we have that many resources. I know it's hard to answer my question, but is there some way to implement photogrammetry from scratch? Are there any resources, maybe tutorials that cover all the processes that happen behind these software so that I can build them on my own? The main two features I most probably need are 3D reconstruction and extracting features of the object.

Title: Why 3Dsurvey is the Best Photogrammetry Software in 2025? | 3Dsurvey
Content: Introduction
The photogrammetry world in 2025 is full of bloated platforms, hidden costs, and tools built for demos – not real work. 3Dsurvey takes a different path. Built by land surveyors in Europe, it offers a clean, modular, and professional solution that delivers exactly what you need – from drone data, cameras and even smartphones, to CAD-ready deliverables, without locking you into overpriced ecosystems. Here’s why thousands of our users believe it is the
best photogrammetry software in 2025
and it’s become the go-to platform for professionals worldwide.
Only surveyors can build the best photogrammetry software in 2025
3Dsurvey wasn’t imagined in a boardroom, it was built in the field. The people behind it are surveyors who got tired of wasting time with software that looked impressive but didn’t help get the job done. That’s why everything in 3Dsurvey, from the interface to the tools, is shaped around how real projects work, not how someone
thinks
they work.

areas, and infrastructure projects. The workflows are practical – they fit the way you already work, instead of forcing you to change everything.
What features does the best photogrammetry software in 2025 need to offer?
Every tool in 3Dsurvey is there for a reason. It’s not built to impress with long feature lists, but to solve problems in the field. Although we must admit, the
features list
is impressive.
It’s also proven. Professionals in more than 35 countries all over the world already rely on it. You’re not joining an experiment – you’re joining a global community of people who use it every day and get results.

Content: RealityCapture
is one of the best known photogrammetry platforms on the market. Since it was acquired by Epic Games in 2021, the software has become better integrated with other CGI and video game modeling solutions. With
LiDAR
support, RealityCapture also continues to allow for data capture at scale, whether it be large objects or landscapes for lifelike special effects.
During testing, we fed demo photos into RealityCapture (admittedly, taken by a beginner). Importing this data was pretty straightforward, although we did occasionally find it difficult to find the right tool for a given task. This complexity can be daunting for complete newcomers, but there are plenty of resources on YouTube & Discord to help you nail down the basics.

Pair your Android phone with RTK GNSS, record the video with a phone, and get thousands of georeferenced frames in one smooth walk-through. Ideal for shafts, smaller sites, and linear structures. It’s fast, simple, and accurate where traditional photogrammetry falls short due to limitations (drone flight restrictions, no trained pilot on site, hard to access).
Supported inputs include JPEG, MP4, LAS, LAZ, E57, XYZ, OBJ, and TXT. Just load mixed datasets into a single project and get to work – no conversions needed.

Content: By using data to inform decisions, businesses can stay ahead of their competition and make better use of their resources.
Actionable insights have some key characteristics, including the following:
Based on data:
Looking at data is one way to get actionable insights, whether you obtain it from market research,
customer
surveys, or financial reports. It can reveal a lot about how your business is performing and where you need to make changes.
Specific:
Actionable insights are specific and clear. They should identify a problem or opportunity and recommend an action.
Actionable:
The whole point of actionable insights is to inform decision-making. To be considered actionable, you should be able to take concrete steps based on these insights.
Timely:
Actionable insights should be based on current data. This is important because decision-makers need to be able to act on the insights while they are still relevant.

Title: What Are Actionable Insights? Definition, Types, and Examples
Content: Relevant:
Actionable insights should be relevant to the decision-maker. This means the insights should be applicable to the specific situation and context.
Credible:
For an insight to be actionable, it needs to be credible. This means it should come from a reliable source and be based on sound data.
Why actionable insights matter
Without actionable insights, data is just numbers on a page. With them, however, data can become a powerful tool for making your business more successful.
Here are some of the benefits of actionable insights.
Making better decisions
Making better decisions is one of the most important things actionable insights can help with. By understanding the data, you can make informed decisions based on evidence rather than your gut feeling. Firstly, this can help you avoid costly mistakes, and secondly, it can help you make decisions more quickly and effectively.

Title: What Are Actionable Insights? Definition, Types, and Examples
Content: Improving efficiency
Understanding what’s working and what’s not enables you to streamline processes and make them more efficient. This can save you time and money and help free up resources to focus on other areas of the business.
Better understanding your customers
Understanding your customers’ needs
and wants lets you tailor your products and services to fulfill them better. Doing so can
improve customer satisfaction
and lead to more sales and repeat business.
Staying ahead of your competition
Being in tune with actionable insights also helps you stay ahead of your competition. Many companies pay more attention to their competition than they do to their own users. This common flaw leads to companies only being able to play catch-up.
In contrast, actionable insights allow companies to become market leaders through learning. They are always one step ahead of their users’ needs rather than their competition.
