A common mistake that we see is when people delete 90% or more of points to make the point cloud smaller so it will work in familiar applications like Civil 3D. This is a process we call “Dumb Decimation”, and it results in losing 90% of the accuracy! Important features, like utilities, fire hydrants, signage, and curbs often disappear entirely in this method, and what is left is of lower quality than it was before. When working in point clouds, use a program designed to work with point clouds, and only ever use the full resolution file.\nKnow the limitations of photogrammetry-based point clouds'}, {'source': 'https://opengeospatialdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40965-017-0024-5', 'title': 'Improving FOSS photogrammetric workflows for processing large image datasets | Open Geospatial Data, Software and Standards | Full Text', 'content': 'The final point cloud had 15 billion points and an average density of 25 points per square meter. The full resolution would have required 4 times more tiles and longer computational time. In that case an estimated density of 100 points per square meter would have been reached. For the visualization of the final point clouds we used Potree [\n29\n,\n30\n] and the Massive-PotreeConverter [\n31\n]. Snapshots of the visualization are shown in Figs.\n10\nand\n11\n\nThe position and the attitude (georeferencing) where each image was acquired are recovered in the image orientation, while the focal length, the principal point position or distortions are determined in the image calibration. The image calibration is usually embedded in the image orientation process, thanks to the self-calibration process [\n17\n]. The image orientation process can be then divided in tie-points extraction, pose initialization and the Bundle Block Adjustment (BBA). In the tie-points extraction the position of the same object points in different overlapping images is performed. The tie-points extraction is usually performed using automated algorithms like SIFT [\n18\n], SURF [\n19\n\nTie-points reduction algorithms\nThe memory requirements for the BBA are in some cases simply unaffordable for large datasets. We propose an elegant solution that consists of running a tie-points reduction before the BBA. The tie-points reduction decreases the number of tie-points effectively decreasing the memory requirements of the BBA. The general idea is that a sufficient number of well distributed tie points in the overlapping images is sufficient to assure a stable and reliable image orientation, as it was commonly done in the traditional analogue Photogrammetry. Two different algorithms of tie-points reduction have been developed. A similar idea of tie-points reduction has been already introduced in a study conducted by Mayer [\n24\n\nThe generation of dense point clouds has been traditionally performed using active sensors like laser scanners due to the easiness, speed and ability to quickly capture millions of points. In the last decade, Photogrammetry has been living a second life pushed by the recent developments in Computer Vision, providing very dense and accurate point clouds compared to LiDAR techniques. Image-based approaches have the advantage of being cheaper than active sensors and they can provide colour and range information just in one acquisition. Photogrammetry is therefore replacing range techniques in many applications (such as archaeology, geology, etc.) due to their reduced costs and the introduction of turnkey platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that makes possible the acquisition of large datasets.\n\n20\n] and the increase in the image overlaps has led to the increase in the amount of data captured on the same area. This has resulted in a wider computational request to process large image datasets. The possibility to parallelize the process on CPUs and GPUs has just partially solved this issue as some steps cannot be easily divided in different processes and the steps are often too time consuming to make the whole process affordable and timely.'}]
