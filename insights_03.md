In photogrammetry, distance measuring depends on multiple factors which potentially increases the chance of errors. Because LiDAR can penetrate vegetation canopies, it is particularly useful for applications like forestry, environmental monitoring, and archaeology. LiDAR can operate day and night, whereas photogrammetry relies on ambient light and is less effective in low-light conditions. It also generally works better under overcast or hazy conditions. LiDAR systems can quickly collect large amounts of data over extensive areas. LiDAR provides direct 3D spatial information, reducing the need for extensive post-processing and interpretation. What are the benefits of combining LiDAR and photogrammetry? Combined LiDAR and photogrammetry offer the strength of each technology: LiDAR provides precise distance measurements, while photogrammetry adds detailed texture and color information.'}, {'source': 'https://www.propelleraero.com/blog/photogrammetric-processing-101-to-self-process-or-to-not-self-process/', 'title': 'Drone Data Processing 101: To Self-Process or Offload Processing', 'content': 'Who needs the processed data and in what file formats? What functionalities do I need from my data? Drone surveying came about to resolve one age-old pain point: the amount of time it took to collect accurate site data. Before, worksites had to choose between collecting survey data quickly or accurately. Traditional methods—walking the site with a base and rover, shooting points—took days (sometimes weeks) for larger sites and the aerial alternative required contacted pilots. Amidst a skilled labor shortage, a surveyor’s time is a hot commodity. The time expense of traditional data collection left little time for site analysis, observations, or application of the findings. With RTK drone hardware and PPK in play, surveyors have the ability to fly a site in a matter of hours and get accuracy down to 1/10ft. But aerial imagery is only a third of most survey outputs. Most workflows integrate position and orientation system (POS) data, ground control points (GCPs).'}, {'source': 'https://www.francescatabor.com/articles/2025/9/9/the-3d-creation-playbook-how-ai-scanning-amp-photogrammetry-collide', 'title': 'The 3D Creation Playbook: How AI, Scanning & Photogrammetry Collide — FRANKI T', 'content': 'In a more everyday scenario, suppose you want to create a 3D model of a shiny ceramic vase with intricate patterns. Photogrammetry alone might capture the patterns (texture) well, but struggle on the shiny surface causing noise or holes. A laser scanner could capture the shape accurately, but its raw texture would be bland or missing. A hybrid solution: scan the vase to get a perfect shape, and also take a set of photos (or even turntable photogrammetry) to capture the artwork on the vase. Then you can map the high-quality photos onto the precise scan geometry. Additionally, while AI normal maps from I2M are great, an artist might notice something off – maybe a seam or a weird bump that shouldn’t be there. Quick fix: jump into Photoshop or Substance Painter and edit the normal map (or clone stamp the diffuse). Or if the normal map is inverted in one channel (common issue when moving between DirectX and OpenGL normals), the artist flips the green channel.'}, {'source': 'https://www.3dmag.com/reviews/photogrammetry-software/what-is-the-best-photogrammetry-software-in-2025/', 'title': 'What is the best photogrammetry software in 2025? – 3D Mag', 'content': 'Reply Hey, surprised not to see Meshroom mentioned here!
